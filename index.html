                 <p class="purple-color"> Founder|Programming Hero </p>
                 <p>In 2019 I know about programming.  I had no idea about programming before.  I understand that I am interested in programming.  But I had no idea how to get started.  I didn't even know where I would type the code.  At that moment I got the programming-hero app.  Then I started learning Python.  You won’t believe how easily topics are explained here.  Now I am learning HTML and CSS.  Thank you so much Jhankar Mahbub vai for introducing me to amazing things.
