                    In 2019 I know about programming. I had no idea about programming before. I understand that I am interested in programming. But I had no idea how to get started. I didn't even know where I would type the code. At that moment I got the <a id="ph" href="https://www.programming-hero.com/"> Programming-Hero</a>  app. Then I started learning Python. You won’t believe how easily topics are explained here. Now I am learning HTML and CSS. Thank you so much Jhankar Mahbub vai for introducing me to amazing things.
